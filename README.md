# nlp customer review classification
Utilizing the women's clothing customer review dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews), determine if, given a customer's review, we can predict if a customer would recommend the product or not. We are specifically interested in how well we can predict if a customer would not recommend a specific product (Recommended IND = 0), and will attempt to create a model with this aspect in mind.
